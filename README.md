# Magic Eight Ball
- This is a first portfolio project for codeacademy full stack developer course
- The javascript code in the js folder randomly selects the eight ball message and formats the message to display within the boundary of the triangle correctly
- When the HTML page loads, it will show a message
- Clicking on the shake button should produce another random message
- The triangle will show up either normally or inverted based on the text within the message
